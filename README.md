### Answers to Questions

**How to use npm with "vanilla" node project**

Just need to run `npm init` & follow the installation instructions which creates a `package.json` file in the root directory

```
âžœ  gitmetrics git:(master) npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
